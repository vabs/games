Hansel and Gratel
(Narrative Game)


I coded this for my games class. The complier is developed in McGill Games Research lab. 

I have placed the thesis by F´elix Martineau, who wrote the complier. In the thesis document you can find all the functionality you can code. 

If any questions; contact me on: njoy.today@gmail.com

Commands

The most important commands in the game are help and look. If you are stuck anytime, try those and you will probably find a way out.
